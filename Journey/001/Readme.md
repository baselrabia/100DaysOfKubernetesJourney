# Day One of 100 Days of Kubernetes 

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Kim! A few weeks ago I heard about 100 Days of Kubernetes through the [DevOps'ish newsletter](https://devopsish.com/216/) and decided to give it a try. 

In 2018, I started my first SRE job at [Fairwinds](https://www.fairwinds.com/) where I worked as Kubernetes administrator for several different clients. In May of 2021, I was hired as a Cloud Native Developer Advocate at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and my job is to spend time learning (and sharing!) about cloud native technologies, especially Kubernetes. 100 Days of Kubernetes is my first learning project in my new role. üòÅ

## Measurable Objectves 

By August 17, 2021 I will... 
* Publish at least 15 posts in my 100DaysofKubernetesJourney github repo 
* Take the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) at least once 
    * I had to take the CKAD exam twice before I passed, and it's okay if I need to take the CKA twice (or more!)
* Submit at least one PR adding content to the [100DaysOfKubernetes Book](https://github.com/100daysofkubernetes/100DaysOfKubernetes)

## My Goals 

During the last few years, I've had a lot of hands-on production experience with some parts of Kubernetes, and I'd like to solidify my understanding of those components and processes. There are also many Kubernetes features that I never used (or only used once or twice), and I'd like to explore those things more deeply. Below are a list of these K8s concepts organized by my level of mastery. 

### üí™üèª K8s Concepts I Know Well 
* Kubernetes Components and Architecture 
* Options for deploying and controlling pods
    * Deployments
    * CronJobs 
    * Daemonsets
* Debugging issues in pods through logs 

### ü™ú K8s Concepts I'm Familiar With, But Want To Learn More Deeply  
* The different kinds of K8s services 
* lables vs. annotations 
* in-cluster Storage: PVs and PVCs 
* Helm 
* CNI and cluster networking 

## üê£ K8s Concepts I Don't Know (Yet)
* cloud-controller-manager 
* Security 
* Logging with opensource tools 
* Monitoring with opensource tools 
* go-kubernetes sdk
